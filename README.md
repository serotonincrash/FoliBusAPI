# FoliBusAPI

A native Swift package for accessing the Föli (Turku Region Public Transport) real-time public transport API.

## Disclaimer

This API is an experimental project for me to try out Xcode's new agentic programming systems. Whilst I will personally do my best to maintain and review the code generated by AI models, I cannot personally guarantee that the wrapper will continue working. The Föli data API updates frequently. Use at your own risk.

## Overview

FoliBusAPI provides a clean, modern Swift interface for accessing:
- Real-time stop monitoring (bus/train arrivals and departures)
- Complete stop list with searchable data
- Vehicle tracking with real-time GPS coordinates (WIP)
- Delay and schedule information (WIP)

## Requirements

- iOS 15.0+ / macOS 12.0+ / watchOS 8.0+ / tvOS 15.0+
- Swift 6.0+
- Xcode 16.0+

## Installation
